- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Awtum
- I use genomic/transcriptomic analysis methods to understand the transmission and evolution of malaria parasites. 
- To achieve my goals, Iâ€™m constantly looking to expand my computational skill set and learn new programming techniques.
- Iâ€™m open to collaboration and consultation for projects which have potential real-world impacts on global health. 
- You may email me at awtum @ usf.edu.
